		<p>We here at <strong>Brousilinni's</strong> believe in only the finest dining. When our founder, Brousilinni Brousini Brousine first founded Brousilinni's
		in the young year of 1396 CE, she pioneered what it meant to truly enjoy one's <em>dining experience</em>. When Brousilinni Brousini Brousine met her husband,
		Brousilinno Brousini Brousune, they pushed the standards of dining in the Middle Ages to the absolute heighest of standards, and they passed those standards onto
		their children: Brousilinni Brousini Brousine and Brousilinno Brousini Brousune the IIs. Brousilinni Brousini Brousine and Brousilinno Brousini Brousune the IIs
		grew into fine upstanding chefs because of their cultivated growth under the roof of Brousilinni's and its <strong>excellent cooking</strong> and eventually met 
		partners of their own, <em>who helped further the immense dining experience of Brousilinni's well into the 1400s</em>. The leadership of Brousilinni's during the 1500's
		fell primarily to Brousilinni Brousini Brousine and Brousilinno Brousini Brousune the IIIs, and Brousilinni's saw its first Golden Age, where for the first time our
		cooking was held in comparison to the Heavens and said to be sought after by the Gods themselves, but this claim was soon dismissed when the Heavens cast out their
		cooks and fruit-bearers to dine exclusively at Brousilinni's. Our <strong>dining expertise</strong> is unparalleled and has been since our foundation, with the
		exception of the brief leadership of Brousilinni Brousini Brousine and Brousilinno Brousini Brousune IVs, but for who could fault them we are the restaurant that
		serves all and any, and the only restaurant acceptable to the Heavens due to our <em>excellence!</em></p>
		</br>
		<p>Now in the dawn of our second Golden Age, I the chief operator of <strong>Brousilinni's</strong>, Brousilinni Brousini Brousine XXXIX, have once again ascended our 
		restaurant to the pinnacle of <em>fine dining</em> through the use of our masterful recipes, cooking staff, and restaurant. If you are not satisfied with the <strong>excellence</strong>
		found in our <em>finest</em> of dishes, then not even the realm above will be to your satisfactions!</p>
